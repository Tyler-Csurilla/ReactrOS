## 🔍 What Was Tested

### Debug Tool UI

![til](https://github.com/Tyler-Csurilla/ReactrOS/blob/main/public/repo_assets/debug_demo.gif?raw=true)

### Debug Panels & Visualizers

- **Icon Grid Visualizer**
  Instantly inspect every desktop icon’s layout in real time:
    - See exact X/Y coordinates for icon placement
    - Monitor live layout parameters: padding, row gap, column gap, icon size

- **Context Data Inspector**
  Browse client‑side session data at a glance:
    - View current theme and background‑manager settings
    - List all desktop icons and their metadata
    - Drill into any other in‑memory state for faster debugging

> These tools update dynamically as you tweak your configuration, providing immediate feedback on how layout and data changes affect the desktop.
